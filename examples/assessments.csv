1,"F9: Fund10 challenge setting","SPO Tools & Community Projects","https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzRm","z_assessor_2028","z_assessor_2028-414105",414105,26604,"SPOs are backbone of Cardano. Since Shelley SPOs started a real decentralization which is now complete, so all the blocks, all transactions are made thanks to Stake Pool Operators. I completely agree with proposer that SPOs play a crucial role in the Cardano Ecosystem. I think we should prioritize this challenge in Fund10. ",5,"The Catalyst community growth is inseparable with the growth of SPOs. Many of SPOs are also doing something else in the ecosystem: take part in Catalyst, create Dapps, do community management, Cardano outreach in the different circles, etc. Still SPOs deserve to have a separate challenge category and our community has the capacity to address the challenge.",5,"In previous funds there were SPO-related category. In some of the funds there was even more than 1 SPO-related category. Time showed that these categories proved to be productive, many new tools and incentives were born from there. Success criteria and suggested metrics are well described and I think the community should prioritize this category. ",5,"Good"
3,"F9: Fund10 challenge setting","Scale-UP Cardano Community Hubs","https://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBzVA","z_assessor_2028","z_assessor_2028-414312",414312,26604,"If we think philosophically, cryptocurrencies are mean to serve the people. The people, the community is the main and major part of every cryptocurrency. We should be happy to have great community in Cardano. But that’s only beginning. To reach the next level of adoption we need to bring more people, therefore - we need to Scale-UP Cardano Community Hubs. So this challenge setting is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.",5,"This challenge was in all recent Funds. Actually, apart from the current Fund, but it was important and very popular of Fund 5-8. The community from all around the world submitted proposals and we can see the rising interest in Cardano and the growing number in Cardano community. That’s why I think this important challenge should continue.",5,"The total budget of $500 000 might look big, but if we take to account that Catalyst is growing from Fund to fund - that’s fine number and it might be even good to increase it in the future. In this particular challenge I’ve seen a lot of worthy proposals which didn’t pass only because they were over the budget. The Key Metrics to measure are well presented and well defined and it’s easy to check them because in this case one doesn’t need to have technical skills. ",5,"Good"
