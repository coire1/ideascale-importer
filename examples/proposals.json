After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem. We created Recalibrating Value, Identity & Impact Through the Blockchain: Cardano Impact Report 2023\u201d.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team also has undertaken the first of its kind Cardano Impact Report.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cardano Impact Report is a comprehensive publication that aims to capture and showcase the positive impact generated by the Cardano community.

My thesis was about to create a complete Video on Demand system with client-server architecture with its own network protocol called Reliable UDP. After graduating, I set up a high-security financial data center in 2004. Then, in 2019, I started a new cyber security startup with three of my staff. The same year, the startup was funded by the largest bank in Turkey.\n\n  \n\n\nI started programming when I was 12 years old, and about 6 years later, I met the Internet, which introduced so many things to me. Open source was the biggest among them. Later on, I wrote a book about Linux and open-source systems. For me, open-source philosophy was the key to real human potential. It was making the secrets of the institutions public.\n\n  \n\n\nIn the corrupt financial system we are used to living in, a person or group named Satoshi designed the decentralized digital currency called Bitcoin. And afterward, new techniques that were not part of our current order began to develop. Then, in 2021, I met Cardano, where like-minded people find each other. So when I dig deeper into Cardano, I suddenly found myself in the Cardano4Climate community trying to do things to stop climate change with a bunch of people all around the world.\n\n  \n\n\nWith friends from Cardano4Climate, we formed up littlefish Foundation. It is a system, a reason for being. Encourage people to do anything for the good of the common.

However, due to the bear market and high server costs, the pool was temporarily retired. Nevertheless, with the collaboration of Victor Grecia and a new partnership, we breathed new life into Adazul by utilizing a bare-metal infrastructure previously employed by his CRIP pool, which had retired at that time and joined forces with Adazul. This historical context served as inspiration for our project idea of a cost-effective server infrastructure.\n\n  \n\n\nCurrently, Adazul (Pool ID pool1z97uz9kzzfdekjjrmxvslvxzyj9jep6thf4he5qtmcdaqvznl8c) is undergoing restructuring, and we are actively investing in its growth. Our Twitter (https://twitter.com/adazulpool) and Telegram (https://t.me/adabrpool\\_ptbr) communities are highly engaged.

This allowed me to acquire the necessary knowledge base in this field. In the mentioned master's program, our thesis topic was agricultural traceability on the blockchain and crop tokenization. We conducted our work based on Cardano and explored the Atala applications built on that network, namely Atala Trace, Scan, and Prism. I took a course on Prism and have plans to expand the use of Cardano through the dissemination of our enterprise applications, starting with the crop traceability one.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-lazo-villanueva-38b68b7/\n\n  \n\n\nCamilo \u00c1vila (Economist - Financial Advisor)\n\nRole: Financial advisory and economic modeling for the project.\n\nExperience: Bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics, Business Administration Minor with focus in Finance, at Los Andes University.

Then I decided to turn my career around and did an MSc in Sustainable Energy Systems at Queen Mary University of London in 2017 where I was able to develop clean hydrogen technology as an energy resource. In my return to Colombia I decided to start my business in agriculture by linking up with small and medium producers, distributing their products in the B2B channel and working under fair trade, making the supply chain more efficient. During this process I have managed to work as a consultant in digital transformation and carbon emissions reduction projects. At this point, I am able to consolidate my knowledge to carry out this project as part of the great WSEEDS team and willing to transform agriculture in Colombia and LATAM through the inclusion of traceability and blockchain technologies to create opportunities, improve productivity and generate transversal efficiencies with an exponentialized impact.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-andres-posada-lopez-b6a9b781/\n\n  \n\n\nJes\u00fas Prada (Physicist - Data Scientist)\n\nRole: Data analysis and development of artificial intelligence models for the project.\n\nExperience: Jes\u00fas has knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem. We created Recalibrating Value, Identity & Impact Through the Blockchain: Cardano Impact Report 2023\u201d.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team also has undertaken the first of its kind Cardano Impact Report.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cardano Impact Report is a comprehensive publication that aims to capture and showcase the positive impact generated by the Cardano community.

Whether funded or not, I do want to take this opportunity to say thank you for your time and efforts... with so many proposals to go through and analyze, I know its no small task to sift through all this information. So sincerely... thanks!!\n\n  \n\n\nA little bit about me: For the last three years I have fallen in love with the Cardano Blockchain! While I wouldn't necessarily call myself a programmer or coder just yet, I have, over the last two years or so, thrown myself into studying/learning code, cryptology, blockchain, math and game design. I have made a study of Haskell (utilizing Robertino Martinez's IOG Academy Courses), Pinescript, Python, C# and The Unity Game Engine. Recently I earned a certificate in Nonlinear Dynamics: Mathematical and Computational Approaches (Spring 2023) from the Santa Fe Institute:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nIt was a fascinating course and really got my brain turning in new ways! It was one of those 'makes you look at the world differently' sort of experiences! Centered around chaos. nonlinear dynamical systems and how to write code to analyze, predict and visualize those systems, I think what I learned in the course will definitely help me in designing the BON3KR Randomizzer, which is the centerpiece of Phase 1!\n\n  \n\n\nBut Let me introduce you to some other team members:\n\n  \n\n\nI'm happy to introduce Amy and Jason Mesick, an incredibly talented, creative married couple I have had the pleasure of collaborating with on several creative endeavors over the years. Together they own/operate an EEG Service Company in Southern California and spend the rest of their time creating offbeat, quirky art - Amy does Graphic Design and is a wiz with all things computers and Jason is one of the best song writers I've ever known! (Incidentally, Jason is very excited about my proposal as he is the only other person I know who is as excited about the future of Cardano as I am!) Here's a link to their Youtube Channel where they make educational songs/videos in the field of neurodiagnostics:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eky1r\\_SfnUw  \n\n\nAmy Garrison Mesick: Graphic Design Consultant.\n\n1. Email: amymmesick@gmail.com\n\n  \n\n\nI have worked with Amy for over five years professionally and at least fifteen on various creative projects. She is a top notch graphic artist, a big time computer nerd and gamer, and an incredible systems builder & troubleshooter. I have enlisted her to help with asset creation and she is excited about the project!\n\n  \n\n\nJason Mesick: Singer/Songwriter; Recording Engineer\n\n1. Email:jasonmesick@gmail.com\n\n  \n\n\nLike Amy, I have worked with Jason for about 5 years and have collaborated with him on musical projects. He is the best songwriter I know and well experienced with recording software and hardware. He's built his own recording studio in his house. He is very excited about composing a theme song and some other music for the game and the flutterbuzzerz.io website.\n\n  \n\n\n....................\n\n  \n\n\nAlex Sevilla, alex.sevilla@toptal.com, Chief Engineer\n\nAlex Kronk, alex.kronk@toptal.com, Project Team Liaison\n\n  \n\n\nI'm excited to have forged, over the last few weeks, excellent relationships at TopTal, recognized as one of the best in the business for providing clients with the developers they need to get projects done.\n\n  \n\n\nMy mindset when I started putting this project together was that, considering we are talking about wallet integration, NFT game assets, native currencies etc, there really is no room for error as far as security goes. And security does not just mean explicit security protocols. Security is reliant of the quality of the code!\n\n  \n\n\nI'll be direct with you. I am not the owner/ceo of some big tech or gaming company, trying to save some money on development. I am a regular joe with a regular job who has a passion for Cardano and Gaming. As such, attaining SOLID professional help in this is absolutely essential - I dont have a staff on hand or 30 years worth of coders in my roller-decks!\n\n  \n\n\nThe benefit of working with toptal is third party, built-in administrative oversite. Because they pride themselves on their reputation, if the developers they provide are not working out, they have a vast resource pool to draw from to ensure I immediately get the staff I need to continue the project without interuption. I asked Alex Sevilla directly if, after they set me up with developers, their workflow is to just disappear from teh equation, or if they are more hands on over the course of the project. They said it can be either/or, and that some clients want them out of the way and some don't, but if I need them to be available for additional help if there are any staffing issues. I told them, I need you to be there the moment there is a problem, issue or question and they said that is exectly what I will get!\n\n  \n\n\nThis TopTal path is perfect for my project and provides a sense of security and assurance, hedging against unforseen complications when it comes to the team itself. Over the last few weeks and several meetings, I feel very confident with TopTal's experience in helping me find the right members for my team and their involvement will ensure there are no slowdowns or stoppages due to staffing issues throughout the course of the project.\n\n  \n\n\nAll that having thoroughly been said, through my conversations with the Alexes, the team composition we've come up with, based on my needs for Phase 1, consists of three people. The first is a Game Designer, the role I will fill, though I will schedule a few hours of consultation with one of TopTals experienced designers in order to help get my vision completely in focus, such that I can convey that vision to the developers. The second and third team members are both developers - one a Game Dev and one a Blockchain Dev. Both of these individuals will work synchronistically on the front and backends of the game. For Phase one to see completion, I will need to engage both front end UI and also how the NFT assets (the flutterbuzzerz themselves) will interact with existing user wallets and the blockchain.",

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem. We created Recalibrating Value, Identity & Impact Through the Blockchain: Cardano Impact Report 2023\u201d.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team also has undertaken the first of its kind Cardano Impact Report.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cardano Impact Report is a comprehensive publication that aims to capture and showcase the positive impact generated by the Cardano community.

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem.

My thesis was about to create a complete Video on Demand system with client-server architecture with its own network protocol called Reliable UDP. After graduating, I set up a high-security financial data center in 2004. Then, in 2019, I started a new cyber security startup with three of my staff. The same year, the startup was funded by the largest bank in Turkey.\n\n  \n\n\nI started programming when I was 12 years old, and about 6 years later, I met the Internet, which introduced so many things to me. Open source was the biggest among them. Later on, I wrote a book about Linux and open-source systems. For me, open-source philosophy was the key to real human potential. It was making the secrets of the institutions public.\n\n  \n\n\nI have been building websites since 1997 and have witnessed the transition from static pages to dynamic sites that utilize scripts and databases. In the past, software developers often worked alone and had to be proficient in various programming languages. However, with the advancement of web technologies, design has been separated from code, allowing designers to focus solely on aesthetics while developers on functionality. I witnessed it all. With over 20 years of experience in data center operations, I have managed the installation and maintenance of numerous PCI-DSS-certified e-money infrastructures, from website design to team management and database configuration.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople can now form communities independent of borders, authorities, and censorship using Cardano. We just need to build solutions on top of it. For the first time in history, we have enough technology to take collective action to create impact and pressure. We better use this chance wisely, otherwise, there will be no world left to live on anymore. In this context, I will continue to do my part with my knowledge and experience. .\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca/\n\nhttps://github.com/ckaraca\n\n  \n\n\nCem is the senior engineer on the project, the design lead, and frontend engineer.

These experiences led him to start Schedulesite.com to re-engage and prioritize family, friends, and living back into society, enabling them to attend events and live a more exciting life full of new post-pandemic experiences.\n\n  \n\n\nAthena Petrou is the COO of Schedulesite, bringing 20 years of product management/development and logistics experience at apparel companies to the team. She has expertise in product life cycle management, design, merchandising, production, distribution, logistics, and marketing. Athena is passionate about building solutions and brands that make major cultural shifts in how people live and enjoy life. Her experience attending countless events worldwide has given her insight into the market gap between event attendance and the technology within them. Therefore, this makes her the ideal candidate for overseeing the operations and marketing aspects of the project.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nAdditionally, we plan to hire staff with expertise in software development, marketing, and web3 technology. We will also seek partnerships with companies such as Snapbrillia, with whom we are already engaged in building the Cardano integration. These measures will ensure we have the necessary resources to develop and launch our blockchain-based scheduling media platform. By assembling a team with diverse skill sets and experience, Schedulesite can ensure that the product is designed to a high standard and marketed to the right audience. Partnering with established companies in the blockchain ecosystem, like Snapbrillia, can also provide valuable resources and connections to help Schedulesite succeed. Additionally, having a team in place can help mitigate the risk of relying too heavily on a single individual or contractor for critical tasks, as the workload can then be distributed among multiple team members.\n\n  \n\n\nThe software development staff will build and maintain the platform's backend infrastructure, develop smart contracts, and create a user-friendly front-end interface. We seek individuals with specific experience in using Cardano blockchain technology, developing practical application components, and implementing scalable solutions. The blockchain staff will be well-versed in blockchain and its development ecosystem, and they will have experience in designing and deploying smart contracts, managing storage solutions, and integrating with cryptocurrency wallets. Lastly, the marketing staff will promote the platform to potential users and partners, develop marketing strategies, and build a community around the product.",

We are privileged to have an outstanding advisory board with people in key positions and strong institutional backgrounds. These individuals possess in-depth knowledge of financial market operations and believe in Xerberus and its capability to achieve its goals. We are not permitted to publish the full names of our advisors, but we can provide proof of our engagements to a trusted representative of the Cardano community under a signed NDA.

At some point, I decided that this industry is what I want to dedicate my life to.*\n\n  \n\n\nI am not a Cardano-maxi but I do create Cardano-based content because it is most aligned with my views on economic philosophy, environmentalism, and technological integrity. I find it most effectively purposeful to serve the Cardano ecosystem by helping drive its mission forward, rather than fragmenting my efforts with other blockchains with different missions.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-noriega-b-a-3086bb117/",

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem. We created Recalibrating Value, Identity & Impact Through the Blockchain: Cardano Impact Report 2023\u201d.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team also has undertaken the first of its kind Cardano Impact Report.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cardano Impact Report is a comprehensive publication that aims to capture and showcase the positive impact generated by the Cardano community.

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem. We created Recalibrating Value, Identity & Impact Through the Blockchain: Cardano Impact Report 2023\u201d.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team also has undertaken the first of its kind Cardano Impact Report.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cardano Impact Report is a comprehensive publication that aims to capture and showcase the positive impact generated by the Cardano community.

My thesis was about to create a complete Video on Demand system with client-server architecture with its own network protocol called Reliable UDP. After graduating, I set up a high-security financial data center in 2004. Then, in 2019, I started a new cyber security startup with three of my staff. The same year, the startup was funded by the largest bank in Turkey.\n\n  \n\n\nI started programming when I was 12 years old, and about 6 years later, I met the Internet, which introduced so many things to me. Open source was the biggest among them. Later on, I wrote a book about Linux and open-source systems. For me, open-source philosophy was the key to real human potential. It was making the secrets of the institutions public.\n\n  \n\n\nI have been building websites since 1997 and have witnessed the transition from static pages to dynamic sites that utilize scripts and databases. In the past, software developers often worked alone and had to be proficient in various programming languages. However, with the advancement of web technologies, design has been separated from code, allowing designers to focus solely on aesthetics while developers on functionality. I witnessed it all. With over 20 years of experience in data center operations, I have managed the installation and maintenance of numerous PCI-DSS-certified e-money infrastructures, from website design to team management and database configuration.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople can now form communities independent of borders, authorities, and censorship using Cardano. We just need to build solutions on top of it. For the first time in history, we have enough technology to take collective action to create impact and pressure. We better use this chance wisely, otherwise, there will be no world left to live on anymore.

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem.

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem.

After applying and learning from funds 4 and 5, along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we constructed a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission, having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world. This has led us to develop new ambitions for the work we do and to expand beyond education.\n\n  \n\n\nMore about the projects we have been involved in: https://sustainableada.com/catalyst/\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExperience and Expertise\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, and Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.)\n\n  \n\n\nSustainable ADA has experience and backgrounds in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, and Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.\u00a0\n\nThe team has been a part of the Cardano ecosystem since 2020 and is very dedicated to the Cardano ecosystem. We created Recalibrating Value, Identity & Impact Through the Blockchain: Cardano Impact Report 2023\u201d.\n\n  \n\n\nThe team also has undertaken the first-of-its-kind Cardano Impact Report.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe Cardano Impact Report is a comprehensive publication aiming to capture and showcase the positive impact of the Cardano community.

Eric brings extensive experience in the software industry, with over 20 years of experience and prior experience as CEO/CTO of a $30 million software business. After successfully selling the business in 2019, Eric has redirected his focus towards AI and Digital Identity projects on Cardano.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEric has a proven track record of delivering projects within the Cardano eco-system, including the following projects won and completed through Catalyst:\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fund 8, Sign-in with Cardano: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/62330\n\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fund 7, NFT Picture Profile AI Generator: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/60921\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhile Eric will handle the majority of the project's tasks, it is acknowledged that there may be specific and challenging tasks that require specialized expertise. In such cases, the specific task could be subcontracted to a relevant experts in the field. However, as of now, no such tasks have been identified, and there are no immediate plans for subcontracting.\n\n  \n\n\nImportant note\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nIt is important to address any concerns regarding the sole founder risk. While there may be perceived risks associated with a project delivered by a single person, Eric has demonstrated a strong track record of accountability and successful project delivery within the Cardano eco-system over the past 18 months.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNotably, Eric has individually delivered projects that have outperformed teams with similar project proposals as \u201cSign-in with Cardano\u201d, some of which have yet to deliver any value even after a year since being awarded contracts. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the consistent track record of successful deliveries of the applicant, rather than solely focusing on the sole founder aspect.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFurthermore, this setup eliminates the additional third-party risk and removes concerns about funding availability due to fluctuations in the ADA/USD exchange rate and/or inflation. It is highly advantageous to have the assurance of a stable financial setup for the project right from the start.\n\n  \n\n\nEric's full commitment and expertise, backed by a 10-month budget, ensures the delivery of those critical software infrastructures for the Cardano community. Building upon past successes, this project will contribute to the growth and advancement of Cardano.",

After applying and learning from both funds 4 and 5 along with lots of support from Cardano community members and teams, we were able to construct a strong proposal together that focused on our goals and ambitions for Sustainable ADA, and the Cardano community\u2019s goals. We submitted a proposal focused on helping Grow Cardano, and Grow Africa.\n\n  \n\n\nWith this funding, we had more capacity to focus on researching and sharing stories from change-makers in Africa and the diaspora, who are engaging with Cardano, creating a better tomorrow, today.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThanks to the Cardano community and the use of their voting power from holding and staking ADA, we successfully secured the funding we were seeking. This helped us to take significant steps towards fulfilling our vision and mission having secured these crucial and helpful funds.\n\n  \n\n\nThrough our time in the Project Catalyst ecosystem, we have been able to create a lot of strong and exciting partnerships with projects and businesses all across the world.

I\u2019ve also completed Python course and have a certificate from Udemy. (https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-a535f095-7275-4cd9-8ff8-a81178aaeb90/)\n\nAs a passionate programmer, I enjoy testing my knowledge by hacking my friends' phones and social media accounts (they initially doubted my abilities), developing applications, and pushing the boundaries of programming languages. My curiosity to learn more about emerging technologies has led me to explore Cardano. I\u2019ve also worked as a community reviewer in Fund 9, so I know my way around Catalyst.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/KayaAcarbay8\n\nhttps://github.com/acarbayk\n\nDiscord: kayabey\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\u00c7a\u011fkan Acarbay//Advisor\n\nCo-founder of littlefish Foundation. In Project Catalyst and involved in Cardano since Fund 7. Organization building, governance, token engineering with long term interest in economics, game theory, behavioral psychology, political science, and history. 3+ years experience as a Backend Developer. Python, REST, Postgres, data modeling. Electrical and Electronics Engineering Major.\n\n  \n\n\nI am the advisor on the project and will help Kaya and Alper by guiding them to the right resources, teaching some topics, joining workshops, podcasts, and twitter spaces.\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/\u00e7a\u011fkan-acarbay-b2210b136/\n\nhttps://github.com/cagkanacarbay/\n\n  \n\n\nCem Karaca//Advisor\n\nCo-founder of littlefish Foundation. \n\n  \n\n\nI started programming when I was 12 years old, and about 6 years later, I met the Internet, which introduced so many things to me. Open source was the biggest among them. Later on, I wrote a book about Linux and open-source systems. For me, open-source philosophy was the key to real human potential. It was making the secrets of the institutions public.\n\n  \n\n\nI have been building websites since 1997 and have witnessed the transition from static pages to dynamic sites that utilize scripts and databases. In the past, software developers often worked alone and had to be proficient in various programming languages. However, with the advancement of web technologies, design has been separated from code, allowing designers to focus solely on aesthetics while developers on functionality. I witnessed it all. With over 20 years of experience in data center operations, I have managed the installation and maintenance of numerous PCI-DSS-certified e-money infrastructures, from website design to team management and database configuration.\n\n  \n\n\nPeople can now form communities independent of borders, authorities, and censorship using Cardano.

He speaks 4 languages: Arabic, English, French and Mandarin Chinese, holds a Bachelor\u2019s of Biochemistry and an MBA. Has worked in the luxury jewelry and watches industry with the LVMH group as well as Richemont. Now, he is an artist and crypto-enthusiast with his NFT works and also his physical prints.\n\n  \n\n\nTo say his journey into art is unconventional is an understatement. Being a creative talent, his younger years were spent creating pieces of art and works of LEGO while letting his imagination unfold. Then came the \u201clost years\u201d as he puts it where he abandoned his love for art to go towards scientific pursuits. All the while his heart was aching to create art again.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nDecades later, he found the time again to go towards the arts during the COVID home quarantine and work from home era. He also dove into artificial intelligence and all that entails. Finding his way to crypto and NFTs, he launched his first NFT collection on OpenSea titled Faces 01. He then quickly burned it and migrated to the Cardano blockchain where he met a lot of success. After getting a taste of the artist in him again, he could no longer go back to his day-time job. Two years of corporate work during the COVID era and creating art on the side made him realize he had to choose between the 2 careers. This time he decided to follow his heart rather than his brain and go full into crypto and art.\n\n  \n\n\nHe is now a full-time crypto enthusiast and AI-generative artist. The AI generative scene is new and exciting re-igniting a passion for him to create and bring his creations to the world. He calls himself AI agnostic, meaning he uses all the AI mediums available to express his vision. He is participating in markets all over Dubai and starting to show his works in solo shows.\n\n  \n\n\nJohn Valdez' Bio:\n\n  \n\n\nJohn is the CEO of Unscroll and has extensive experience managing and working with teams within Cardano including the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, Summon Association, ADAO, Scapegoat Media... and is currently focused on helping lead the Cardano community into the age of Voltaire\n\n  \n\n\nAlexa\u2019s Bio:\n\nA creative designer with a background in design, branding, and UI/UX with a strong focus in the crypto space.

    "proposer_relevant_experience": "The core team behind Xerberus consists of four highly accomplished and competent members.\n\n  \n\n\nSimon Peters is the Director of Xerberus LTD. From 2019 to 2022, he served as the CEO of DECUS Network, a corporate venture based in Berlin. Under Simon's leadership, DECUS secured one million USD in venture funding, and the custody infrastructure he led the development of is currently used by institutional players within the EU. Throughout this period, Simon collaborated with several Tier 1 banks within the EU and conducted activities at the intersection of emerging regulations, institutional adoption of blockchain technology, and creation of technology capable of fulfilling the specific requirements of these intersections. This experience makes Simon an excellent fit to work on Xerberus for the Cardano community: https://www.linkedin.com/in/snj-peters/\n\n  \n\n\nNoah Detwiler (Data Hippo) is the Chief Scientist of Xerberus LTD, responsible for developing the data models supporting Xerberus' Risk Assessment of Cardano native assets. As a physicist, he graduated with distinction and was recognized as an outstanding student on the Dean's List from Ariel University. Noah's background as an applied econophysicist equips him with a profound understanding of the application of mathematical models and statistical analysis to complex economic systems. His proficiency in intricate data modeling, coupled with his expertise in physics and econometrics, empowers him to devise innovative solutions for complex challenges, such as managing the noisy and sparse nature of blockchain data. Throughout his journey, he has honed his skills as a proficient SQL and Python programmer: https://www.linkedin.com/in/noachdetwiler/\n\n  \n\n\nMatthias Guilbert is the primary front-end developer at Xerberus. Matthias has had an extraordinary life journey that consistently required him to overcome the impossible. He served in the military for five years before applying the learnings from the French Navy Special Forces to the civilian business world, leading various challenging projects, occasionally in conflict zones. He ultimately became a software developer focusing on real-world solutions enabled by tech products. Matthias' greatest strength is the MERN stack. He is an avid technology enthusiast and continuously learns new programming languages. https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-guilbert/\n\n  \n\n\nOur fourth full-time core team member and first employee is Mihir. He is a skilled back-end developer who has been coding since his early teenage years. He worked various positions and is a critical support for our development efforts.\u00a0(https://github.com/Mi88ir?tab=overview&from=2023-07-01&to=2023-07-11)\n\n  \n\n\nWhile this capable core team is central to Xerberus, the company is larger than that. We are privileged to have an outstanding advisory board with people in key positions and strong institutional backgrounds. These individuals possess in-depth knowledge of financial market operations and believe in Xerberus and its capability to achieve its goals. We are not permitted to publish the full names of our advisors, but we can provide proof of our engagements to a trusted representative of the Cardano community under a signed NDA. Our first advisor has decades of experience in institutional trading. Among other things, this individual has built quantitative trading strategies and managed hedge funds in London, New York, and Silicon Valley. This person currently holds a managerial position at the largest data broker in the market. Our second advisor is, among other roles, a former Executive Director of Goldman Sachs New York and currently manages his own proprietary quant crypto trading firm.\n\n  \n\n\nLastly, we are fortunate to have the support of a dedicated group of community supporters and highly skilled freelancers who excel in building large databases and developing machine learning models. As we continue to grow, we plan to hire at least two of our supporters to expand the team using the funds raised. These new team members will focus on enhancing our capabilities in machine learning and managing large databases. By integrating their expertise into our existing team, we aim to further fortify our research and development capacity.",
